# challenge

First of all, i'm thankful for be considered able to join this challenge.
I really wanted to deal with it using Swift/ Objective-C, but some issues made me got in troubles.
I could not learn at time, so due to this, the project were built using flutter framework, that uses DART language.
The framework builds a native app for both Android and IOS architecture.
